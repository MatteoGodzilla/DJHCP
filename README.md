# DJHCP

Dj Hero Control Panel for windows.
Adding customs has never been this easy

## Build instructions

This is a Visual studio 2019 project, made for C# and WPF.
Just open the vcxproj file and build.

Sadly, there is no Linux/Mac Os support at the moment

## Usage

**!DISCLAIMER!: DJHCP only works with extracted and visible files from the original Dj Hero games. This readme does not include a guide on how to do that.**

**If you haven't started yet and want to try customs, DJHCP has been tested and is fully working under/with Dj Hero 2 game files. Compatibility for the first Dj Hero is NOT guaranteed**

* Open the WII,PS3 or X360 folder inside the extracted files with the top right button. (you'll only have a single folder from the list before)
* Add a custom with the central button or remove already existing customs
* Update files
* Profit
